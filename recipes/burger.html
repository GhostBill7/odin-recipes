    <h2>Smash Burger Description</h2>

    <p>
        It’s a thin, crispy burger cooked on a hot griddle, where the magic happens. As it sizzles away, those little browned bits form a flavor-packed crust that gives each bite a satisfying crunch. The quick, high-heat cooking locks in all the juicy goodness, making each burger a little crispy masterpiece.

        Smashburgers shot to fame thanks to the Smashburger chain, and the name says it all. The burger is literally smashed with a large spatula or bacon press, flattening it out to create those irresistible crispy edges. It’s all about that perfect combination of texture and flavor!
