    <h2>Smash Burger Description</h2>

    <p>
        It’s a thin, crispy burger cooked on a hot griddle, where the magic happens. As it sizzles away, those little browned bits form a flavor-packed crust that gives each bite a satisfying crunch. The quick, high-heat cooking locks in all the juicy goodness, making each burger a little crispy masterpiece.
    </p>

    <p>
        Smashburgers shot to fame thanks to the Smashburger chain, and the name says it all. The burger is literally smashed with a large spatula or bacon press, flattening it out to create those irresistible crispy edges. It’s all about that perfect combination of texture and flavor! 
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef (80/20 ratio) – 1/4 to 1/3 pound per burger for that perfect juicy, flavorful patty.</li>
        <li>Burger buns – Soft, lightly toasted to hold all that goodness together.</li>
        <li>Salt – For seasoning the patty and bringing out its flavor.</li>
        <li>Pepper – To add a little kick.</li>
        <li>Cheese (optional) – American cheese is a classic, but cheddar or Swiss also work great.</li>
        <li>Toppings – Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, or anything you like.</li>
        <li>Condiments – Ketchup, mustard, mayo, or special sauce, depending on your taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Form hamburger into four loosely shaped balls. Fresh ground beef will have more flavor than frozen meat.</li>
        <li>Heat Griddle. You want your griddle hot, about 375 degrees F. I like to put my cast iron griddle on my outdoor grill but you can also do it on your stovetop but I find it sets my smoke alarm off frequently! If you don’t have a griddle you can also</li>
        <li>Place the balls of meat onto a hot griddle.</li>
        <li>After placing hamburger on hot griddle place a piece of parchment paper over the top and then smash. You want a nice thin patty. The parchment paper keeps the meat from sticking to the spatula.</li>
        <li>Add seasoning salt generously.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2-3 minutes, the burger cooks fast. The edges of the burger will be lacy and may even have some holes in it, this is what creates the crispy edges that are a trademark of the Smash Burger.</li>
        <li>Flip the burger by using a metal spatula to “scrap” the burger up and flip. You want to get all that crusty goodness that is forming on the other side of the burger as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Add cheese immediately after flipping. Let the cheese melt for a few seconds. Then take the paddy off the griddle and place it on to a plate.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on to the griddle. Let the patties cook for about 2-3 minutes without touching them. Take off when finished.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Burger to your liking</li>

    </ol>
